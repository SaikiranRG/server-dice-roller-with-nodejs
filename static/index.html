  Project: Server Dice roller with Node.js
  Credits: This file was created using a combination of ChatGPT (OpenAI) 
           assistance and class-provided templates. Additional modifications 
           and customizations were made by me
  AI Usage: ChatGPT was used to suggest structure. I adapted and merged those with available templates.
